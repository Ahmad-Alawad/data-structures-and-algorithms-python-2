# Stacks-and-Queues

## Challenge
classes that have methods to add or delete to the stacks and queues

 ## Approach & Efficiency
i used classes and loops 

### BIG O
###### Stacks
push method
* space --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
* time --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
pop method
* space --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
* time --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
peek method
* space --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
* time --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
isEmpty method
* space --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
* time --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
###### Queues
enqueue method
* space --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
* time --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
dequeue method
* space --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
* time --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
peek method
* space --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
* time --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
isEmpty method
* space --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)
* time --> Big O = O(1) --> constant time(no loops)


###### API
 **Stack**:

push: it takes one value as argument and push it to the top of the stack

pop: it pop the node in the top of the stack..

peek: returns to you the value of the node in the top of the stack

is_empty: returns boolen if the stack is empty or not


**Queue**:

enqueue: it takes one value as argument and add it to the rear of the queue
dequeue: it pop the node in the fornt of the queue..
peek: returns to you the value of the node in the front of the queue..
isEmpty: returns boolen if the queue is empty or not..
